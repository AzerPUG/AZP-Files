Timers and upcoming spawn locations for Helltides, World Bosses and Legions make it easy to plan around your farming and optimizes your play time. | [Baldurs Map](https://www.overwolf.com/app/AzerPUG-Baldurs_Map?utm_campaign=Page&utm_medium=GH) is the first and only Overwolf app for Baldur's Gate III. It is a user friendly, interactive, extensive map for game overlay or 2nd screen. The app shows locations of herbs, containers, companions, encounters, vendors and more. With the easy transfer locations, going through a door to another part of the map is made easy for navigation. | [Starfield Companion](https://www.overwolf.com/app/AzerPUG-Starfield_Companion?utm_campaign=Page&utm_medium=GH) provides crucial information about Star Systems, Planets and Moons. It shows resources to make it easy to decide where to build an outpost next. The app also provides more information about Ship Parts then the game initially does, to help the player determine what the best parts are for them and their current ship. |
